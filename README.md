# student-test-scores-data

This project utilizes two data sets:

1. EducatorEffectivenessSnapshot.xlsx contains a summary of teacher effectiveness ratings broken out by school. Teachers are assigned a rating of Highly Effective, Effective, Minimally Effective, or Ineffective based on the districtâ€™s teacher evaluation rubric.

2. student_scores contains aggregated student test results for the 2013-2014 state assessment for all schools in a district, with results broken out by grade and subgroup.

In part one of this project, I will summarize the Student Scores data to show the percent of students who are proficient or higher in math at each school. I will then populate a table showing the top ten schools in math proficiency along with their proficiency rates (percent of students scoring at proficient or higher).

In part two of this project, I will explore the relationship between math proficiency and educator effectiveness at the school level.
